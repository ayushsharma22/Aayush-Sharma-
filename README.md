![itsme](assets/ItsMe.svg)

I am an Engineering Student and I love to design and code. I started a company called Parallel Pvt. which is the parent company to all my projects as well as a Custom Software/Design Development Agency. In the world :earth_asia: of Cocktails , you've got to have a perfect mix. I'm like a great mix with just right balance of hardwork, fresh perspective and seasoned knowledge to create something beautiful and innovative.

I love executing ideas and build something that people find value in :sunflower:.
Whether you'd like to discuss building an idea together, ask me a question or just want to say hi, my inbox is always open :smile:</br>
